    <p>Modern humans arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa no later than 55,000 years ago.<sup><a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India#cite_note-Combined-1-30"><sup>[24]</a></sup> Their long
        occupation, initially in varying forms of isolation as hunter-gatherers, has made the region highly diverse,
        second only to Africa in human genetic diversity.<sup><a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India#cite_note-Dyson2018-28a-31">[25]</a></sup> Settled life
        emerged on the subcontinent in the western margins of the Indus river basin 9,000 years ago, evolving gradually
        into the Indus Valley Civilisation of the third millennium BCE.<sup><a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India#cite_note-Combined-2-32">[26]</a></sup> By 1200 BCE, an
        archaic form of Sanskrit, an Indo-European language, had diffused into India from the northwest, unfolding as
        the language of the Rigveda, and recording the dawning of Hinduism in India.<sup><a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India#cite_note-Combined-3-33">[27]</a></sup> The Dravidian
        languages of India were supplanted in the northern and western regions.<sup><a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India#cite_note-Combined-4-34">[28]</a></sup> By 400 BCE,
        stratification and exclusion by caste had emerged within Hinduism,<sup><a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India#cite_note-Dyson2018-16a-35">[29]</a></sup> and Buddhism and
        Jainism had arisen, proclaiming social orders unlinked to heredity.<sup><a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India#cite_note-Fisher2018-59-36">[30]</a></sup>Early political
        consolidations gave rise to the loose-knit Maurya and Gupta Empires based in the Ganges Basin.<sup><a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India#cite_note-Combined-5-37">[31]</a></sup> Their collective era
        was suffused with wide-ranging creativity,[32] but also marked by the declining status of women,[33] and the
        incorporation of untouchability into an organised system of belief.[g][34] In South India, the Middle kingdoms
        exported Dravidian-languages scripts and religious cultures to the kingdoms of Southeast Asia.[35].</p>
